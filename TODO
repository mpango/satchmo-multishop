#3    Only superusers shall see the "site" field in the admin. The value a
      user sets there is already overwritten for non-superusers, but they can
      still see that field, which will likely lead to confusion.

#4    Only superusers may set and change the site setting of a user.

#7    How to handle registration.RegistrationProfile? Do we have to overwrite
      the manager here? The docs say, it provides "a mechanism for
      automatically creating an instance of a site-specific profile
      model". What exactly does that "site-specific profile" mean for us?
      Also, find out if the satchmo admin for it uses an admin.ModelAdmin
      subclass or simply the default (which we currently only use).

#10   Add per-site-skins: https://bitbucket.org/bkroeze/django-site-skins

#11   The admin crashes (without any exception thrown) when there is a
      MultishopProduct returned by the admin's queryset method. Reason may
      be recursion issues? Currently "only" a real issue for super admins
      (since they are the only ones where ALL products are returned in the
      admin) and in case you are running a virtual shop but would also want
      to add your own products (is this Use Case actually required?).
