#7    How to handle registration.RegistrationProfile? Do we have to overwrite
      the manager here? The docs say, it provides "a mechanism for
      automatically creating an instance of a site-specific profile
      model". What exactly does that "site-specific profile" mean for us?
      Also, find out if the satchmo admin for it uses an admin.ModelAdmin
      subclass or simply the default (which we currently only use).

#14   When adding a Product, all it's ConfigurableProducts that may exist are
      also added automatically to to the virtual shops. To me, that makes
      perfect sense and I'd leave it like that. However, maybe someone does
      not want to have this behaviour?

#15   MultishopProductAdmin#get_form seems to cause problems sometimes. When
      the admin is open with a superuser in Safari and a limited user in
      Firefox, the admin panel on Safari shows the version for limited users
      only. This happens everytime after the site has once been viewed in FF
      with the limited user.

#20   Satchmo's configurable is missing in the server's auth system.
      Something must have gone wrong with the initial satchmo installation
      there. Add the missing ones manually and contact admin about that issue

#21   Some tables are MyISAM where they actually all should be InnoDB. Fix
      that and also add the missing foreign key constraints etc. afterwards.
